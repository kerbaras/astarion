# ASTARION PROJECT OVERVIEW

## PROJECT VISION
Astarion is an intelligent assistant that revolutionizes tabletop RPG character creation by ensuring every decision is valid, optimized, and properly sourced. It bridges the gap between casual players who need guidance and veteran optimizers who demand accuracy.

## CORE PROBLEM STATEMENT
Creating RPG characters involves navigating hundreds of interconnected rules across multiple books. Players face:
- Rule conflicts and unclear interactions
- Missing prerequisites discovered mid-game
- Suboptimal builds that frustrate players
- Hours spent cross-referencing rulebooks
- Disputes about rule interpretations without clear sources

## SOLUTION APPROACH
Astarion provides an intelligent system that:
1. **Validates Every Decision**: No more illegal character builds
2. **Cites Every Rule**: Every validation includes book and page references
3. **Suggests Optimizations**: MinMax strategies for players who want them
4. **Learns From Rulebooks**: Upload any PDF to support new systems
5. **Explains Interactions**: Understands how rules combine and conflict

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS
- **Source Attribution**: Unlike other builders, EVERY rule application includes precise citations
- **Multi-System Architecture**: Not locked to one RPG system
- **Intelligent PDF Processing**: Automatically extracts and understands rules from uploaded books
- **Optimization Engine**: Goes beyond validation to suggest powerful combinations
- **Extensible Design**: Community can add new systems without code changes

## TARGET USERS

### Primary Users
1. **New Players**: Need guidance on legal character options
2. **Experienced Players**: Want optimization suggestions and rule verification  
3. **Game Masters**: Need quick rule lookups and character validation
4. **Online Players**: Require builds that work in strict online environments

### User Scenarios
- "Is this multiclass combination legal?"
- "What's the most damage-optimized level 5 build?"
- "Why can't my dwarf be a bladesinger?"
- "What page says rogues get Evasion?"
- "How do these two feats interact?"

## SUCCESS METRICS
- **Accuracy**: 100% rule validation accuracy with source citations
- **Coverage**: Support for major RPG systems (D&D 5e, Pathfinder, etc.)
- **Speed**: Character validation in under 3 seconds
- **Adoption**: Used by major VTT platforms
- **Community**: Active ecosystem of contributed rulesets

## ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY

### Design Principles
1. **Accuracy Above All**: Wrong answers are worse than no answers
2. **Show Your Work**: Every decision must be traceable to source material
3. **Extensibility First**: Adding new systems should not require code changes
4. **Intelligence + Determinism**: LLMs for understanding, rules engines for execution
5. **Community Driven**: Enable users to contribute and verify rules

### Technical Approach
- **Hybrid Intelligence**: LLMs understand natural language rules, deterministic engines execute them
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents handle different aspects
- **Source of Truth**: Original rulebooks remain authoritative
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if some components fail
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic validation works immediately, optimization improves over time

## CORE CAPABILITIES

### 1. Character Validation
- Verify ability scores against generation method
- Check class/race compatibility
- Validate feat prerequisites
- Ensure equipment proficiency
- Confirm spell selections

### 2. Rule Explanation
- Explain why choices are valid/invalid
- Show rule interactions
- Clarify ambiguous situations
- Provide official interpretations

### 3. Build Optimization  
- Suggest optimal ability arrays
- Recommend synergistic combinations
- Identify powerful multiclass options
- Calculate damage output potential
- Balance survivability vs offense

### 4. Rulebook Processing
- Extract rules from PDF uploads
- Identify game mechanics
- Build searchable indices
- Generate executable rules
- Maintain source mappings

## PROJECT BOUNDARIES

### What Astarion IS
- Character creation assistant
- Rule validation system  
- Optimization advisor
- Source reference tool
- Rulebook digitizer

### What Astarion IS NOT
- Virtual tabletop (VTT)
- Campaign manager
- Dice roller
- Combat tracker
- Story generator

## INTEGRATION PHILOSOPHY
Astarion enhances existing tools rather than replacing them:
- Export to Roll20, FoundryVTT, etc.
- API for third-party integration
- Standard data formats
- Plugin architecture
- White-label capabilities

## LONG-TERM VISION
Become the trusted intelligence layer for tabletop RPGs:
- Every VTT integrates Astarion for validation
- Publishers use it to verify rule consistency
- Tournament organizers ensure legal characters
- New players learn rules through intelligent guidance
- Veteran players discover new optimizations
