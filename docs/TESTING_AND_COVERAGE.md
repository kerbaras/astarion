# Testing and Coverage Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive testing and coverage infrastructure for the Astarion project. The current coverage is at **64%** with a target of **80%**.

## What We Implemented

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- **pytest.ini**: Configuration for pytest with coverage settings
- **conftest.py**: Shared fixtures and test utilities
- **Mock Qdrant Client**: For testing without requiring actual Qdrant instance
- **Test categories**: Unit, integration, smoke, RAG, agents

### 2. Test Suites Created

#### RAG Pipeline Tests
- `test_extractor.py`: PDF extraction tests (67% coverage)
- `test_chunker.py`: Intelligent chunking tests (76% coverage)
- `test_embedder.py`: Embedding generation tests (97% coverage)
- `test_retriever.py`: Qdrant retrieval tests (57% coverage)
- `test_rag_pipeline.py`: End-to-end pipeline tests
- `test_pipeline_integration.py`: Integration tests

#### Agent Tests
- `test_agents.py`: Tests for all agent implementations
- `test_basic_workflow.py`: Workflow orchestration tests

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
  - Linting with ruff, black, and mypy
  - Unit tests with coverage reporting
  - Integration tests with Docker services
  - Security scanning with Trivy
  - Matrix testing for Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
  - Automatic coverage upload to Codecov

### 4. Coverage Configuration
- **pytest coverage**: Configured to fail if below 80%
- **Codecov integration**: `.codecov.yml` for coverage reporting
- **HTML coverage reports**: Generated in `htmlcov/`
- **Coverage exclusions**: Proper patterns for excluding non-testable code

### 5. Pre-commit Hooks
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Automated code quality checks
- Black formatting
- Ruff linting
- mypy type checking
- pytest smoke tests

### 6. Development Tools
- **Makefile commands**:
  - `make test`: Run all tests
  - `make test-coverage`: Run with coverage report
  - `make test-unit`: Run unit tests only
  - `make test-integration`: Run integration tests
  - `make test-smoke`: Quick smoke tests
  - `make coverage-report`: Generate HTML coverage

### 7. Documentation
- **TESTING_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive testing documentation
- **TESTING_AND_COVERAGE.md**: This summary

## Current Coverage Status

| Module | Coverage | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| embedder.py | 97% | Excellent coverage |
| orchestrator.py | 86% | Good coverage |
| chunker.py | 76% | Good coverage |
| validation.py | 76% | Good coverage |
| extractor.py | 67% | Needs improvement |
| retriever.py | 57% | Needs Qdrant running |
| agents | 33-62% | Needs fixes |
| cli.py | 0% | Not tested yet |

**Overall: 64% (Target: 80%)**

## Known Issues to Fix

1. **Qdrant Connection**: Many tests fail without Qdrant running
   - Solution: Use mock_qdrant_client fixture consistently
   
2. **Agent Tests**: Missing metadata attribute
   - Solution: Update tests to match current implementation
   
3. **Chunker Config**: Overlap larger than chunk size
   - Solution: Adjust test parameters
   
4. **URL Parsing**: RulesetAgent failing on URL parsing
   - Solution: Fix settings URL format

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Failing Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Start with fixing agent tests
   pytest tests/test_agents.py -k "test_stats_agent_init" -vv
   ```

2. **Improve Coverage**:
   - Add CLI tests
   - Complete agent test coverage
   - Add more edge case tests

3. **Enable Mock by Default**:
   - Update conftest.py to auto-mock Qdrant when not available
   - Add environment variable to control mocking

4. **Run Coverage Locally**:
   ```bash
   # With Docker services
   make docker-up
   make test-coverage
   make docker-down
   
   # With mocks only
   MOCK_SERVICES=true make test-coverage
   ```

## Success Metrics

✅ Comprehensive test structure implemented  
✅ CI/CD pipeline configured  
✅ Coverage reporting integrated  
✅ Pre-commit hooks set up  
✅ Documentation created  
⚠️  Coverage at 64% (need 80%)  
❌ Some tests failing (fixable)

## Conclusion

We have successfully implemented a robust testing and coverage infrastructure for Astarion. While the current coverage is below target, the foundation is solid and the remaining work involves fixing test implementations rather than creating new infrastructure. The testing framework supports the project's goal of ensuring valid, optimized, and properly sourced RPG character decisions.
